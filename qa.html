Also it can add events.IT is not a programming language but a programming interface.The DOM views an HTML document as a objects with specific attributes. These objects are referred to as node in DOM.
            </p>

            <p>There are some main purpose of DOM. <br>
                1.Easy to develop interface and change objects.<br>
                2.To changing the document structure, style, and content.<br>
                3.Maintain a standard programming interface for HTML.<br>
                4.To update the content, structure and style of the document and a way to represent it in any language.<br>
                5.It makes a platform language neutral and provide that allows the dynamic usage of the scripts.<br>

            <h2>2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods ?</h2>
            <p>There are many ways to select HTML elements using DOM (Document Object Model). Depending on you needs and what element you want to select there are various DOM methods.
                <p>There are sone DOM methods for selecting HTML elements:<br>
                1.getElementsByTagName()<br>
                2.getElementsByClassName()<br>
                3.getElementById()<br>
                4.querySelector()<br>
                5.querySelectorAll()<br>
                </p>

            <h2>3.What is event bubble??</h2>
            <p>Event bubbling is a event that occurs in the Document Object Model when another event is triggered on a particular element. It happens when an element receives an event, and that event is transmitted to its parent in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.In short, It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy.

            <h2>4.What is a callback function and why will you use it ?</h2>
            <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.The main function is called with a callback function as its argument, and when the main function is finished, it calls the callback function to provide a result. Callbacks allow you to handle the results of an asynchronous operation in a non-blocking manner, which means that the program can continue to run while the operation is being executed.</p>
            <p>There are sone DOM methods for selecting HTML elements:<br>
                1.Callbacks allow us to execute code asynchronously.<br>
                2.Callbacks helps us to make code more modular and reusable.<br>
                3.Callbacks are important in event-driven programming.<br>
                4.Callbacks can be used to abstract and encapsulate complex.<br>
                5.Callbacks can be used to inject dependencies into a function or method by passing in a function.<br>
